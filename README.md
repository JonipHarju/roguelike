# Roguelike game

This is a personal project focused on learning how to build a classic ASCII roguelike from scratch.
The goal is to learn more about programming, game development concepts and have fun while making everything from scratch myself

## Why Lua and LÖVE?
I chose Lua and Löve for this project because:
- I wanted to learn a new programming language.
  - Lua is known for being easy, fast to pick up and used widely in game development
- I wanted to get better at programming, not just learn an engine or library (godot, unity, rltk etc..)
  - Instead of relying/learning tools mentioned above I wanted to focus more on actually coding and solving problems like procedural dungeon generation myself
- Löve was a nice middle ground.
  - It handles things like rendering on screen for me, so I can focus on coding gameplay system without too much of a setup.
